Hey Richie!!

I exported the joey folder and all its assets.

Joey/ LEVEL.UNITY is the scene file with the level.
Im hoping it opens for you with no issues


Will send a rigged valkarie over tomorrow but everything else should be good, any issues let me know!
materials are in the models folder
